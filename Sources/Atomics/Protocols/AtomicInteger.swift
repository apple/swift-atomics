/// A type that supports atomic integer operations through a separate
/// atomic storage representation.
///
/// Atomic integer types provide a number of additional atomic
/// operations beyond the ones supported by `AtomicValue`, such as
/// atomic increments/decrements as well as atomic bitwise operations.
/// These may be mapped to dedicated instructions that can be more
/// efficient than implementations based on the general compare and
/// exchange operation; however, this depends on the capabilities of
/// the compiler and the underlying hardware.

/// pointer-based atomic operations.
///
/// This is a low-level implementation detail of atomic types; instead
/// of directly handling conforming types, it is usually better to use
/// the `UnsafeAtomic` or `ManagedAtomic` generics -- these provide a
/// more reliable interface while ensuring that the storage is
/// correctly constructed and destroyed.

  ///   - operand: The value to add to the current value.
